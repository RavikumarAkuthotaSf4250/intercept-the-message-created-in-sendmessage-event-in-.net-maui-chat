How to intercept the message created in SendMessage event in .NET MAUI CHAT?

## Sample

```xaml  
      <sfChat:SfChat x:Name="sfChat"
                       Messages="{Binding Messages}"
                       SendMessageCommand="{Binding SendMessageCommand}"
                       CurrentUser="{Binding CurrentUser}" />

ViewModel:

    public ICommand SendMessageCommand { get; set; }

    public GettingStartedViewModel()
    {
        SendMessageCommand = new Command(ExecuteSendMessageCommand);
    }

   private void ExecuteSendMessageCommand(object obj)
   {
        // Skips adding new message in Messages collection.
        var eventArgs = obj as Syncfusion.Maui.Chat.SendMessageEventArgs;
        eventArgs!.Handled = true;

        // Retrieve message using SendMessageEventArgs.Message.
        // Now add the actual sent message into collection as required.
        var message = eventArgs.Message;
        if (message != null) { this.Messages.Add(message); }

        // You can add the special message into collection as like below.
        TextMessage textMessage = new TextMessage() { Author = this.CurrentUser };
        textMessage.Text = "Special Message";
        this.Messages.Add(textMessage);
   }

```
